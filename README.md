# marks-markdown-manager (mmm)

A CLI tool for distributing AI tool configuration across multiple AI coding assistants.

## Problems it solves

**1. Distribution across tools**

Skills, subagents, and global context (e.g. `AGENTS.md`) need to reach multiple AI tools — Claude Code, Windsurf, Gemini CLI, Codex CLI, etc. — each with their own directory conventions. Maintaining separate copies manually is error-prone and tedious. `mmm` keeps one canonical source and deploys to all targets.

**2. Control over many sources**

An engineer may have multiple potential sources for these assets (personal, team, org-wide, project-specific). `mmm` gives explicit control over which sources are active and what gets deployed, so you're never guessing what's actually loaded into your tools.

## Getting started

### 1. Install (one-time setup)

Recommended for daily use:

```bash
uv tool install --editable /Users/mpallone/src/mpallone/marks-markdown-manager
```

This installs `mmm` on your shell `PATH` without requiring you to create or activate a manual virtualenv. `uv` manages the isolated Python environment for you.

`uv tool` installs executables into:

```bash
/Users/mpallone/.local/bin
```

Make sure that directory is on your `PATH`, then verify the install:

```bash
which mmm
mmm --help
```

If you prefer direct control of the Python environment while developing on this repo, the old manual option still works:

```bash
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install --upgrade pip
pip install -e .
```

Re-run `uv tool install --editable ...` or `pip install -e .` only if you change package metadata such as `pyproject.toml`. Code changes in `src/mmm/` are picked up automatically because the install is editable.

### 2. Create your source content

Organize your canonical AI configuration files:

```
~/my-ai-config/
├── context/
│   ├── persona.md             # global persona / behavior instructions
│   └── coding-standards.md    # coding rules applied everywhere
├── skills/
│   └── code-review/
│       └── SKILL.md           # each skill is a directory with a SKILL.md
└── subagents/
    └── researcher/
        └── SKILL.md
```

### 3. Create your config file

```bash
cp mmm.yaml.example ~/mmm.yaml
```

Edit `~/mmm.yaml` to:
- Point `sources` at your actual content directories
- Adjust tool target directories if needed (defaults in the example cover standard locations)

#### Example: combining personal and work sources

Sources don't all have to live in one place. A common setup is a personal repo
with generic preferences and a work repo with employer-specific material:

```
~/personal-ai-config/            # personal repo
├── AGENTS.md                    # generic: writing style, tone, general preferences
└── skills/
    └── code-review/
        └── SKILL.md

~/work-ai-config/                # work repo
├── AGENTS.md                    # work-specific: team conventions, internal terminology
└── skills/
    └── deploy-runbook/
        └── SKILL.md
```

A config that combines them (tool targets omitted — use the `tools:` section
from `mmm.yaml.example`):

```yaml
context:
  sources:
    - ~/personal-ai-config/AGENTS.md   # generic writing style and preferences
    - ~/work-ai-config/AGENTS.md       # work-specific standards
  exclude: []

skills:
  sources:
    - ~/personal-ai-config/skills/     # skills from your personal repo
    - ~/work-ai-config/skills/         # skills from your work repo
  exclude: []
```

On `mmm deploy`:

- The two `AGENTS.md` files are concatenated, in the order listed, into a
  single context file per tool (`~/.claude/CLAUDE.md`, `~/.gemini/GEMINI.md`,
  `~/.codex/AGENTS.md`, ...). Each section is prefixed with a
  `<!-- Source: ... -->` comment so you can always tell which repo a rule
  came from.
- Skills are gathered from both repos and each is copied as its own directory
  into every tool's skills location, so `code-review/` and `deploy-runbook/`
  end up side by side in e.g. `~/.claude/skills/`.

Context sources can be individual `.md` files (as above) or directories, in
which case every `.md` file inside them is included. Skill sources are
directories whose subdirectories each hold one skill.

### 4. Deploy

```bash
# Preview what would happen without writing anything
mmm deploy --config /path/to/dir/mmm.yaml --dry-run

# Deploy for real
mmm deploy --config /path/to/dir/mmm.yaml

# Deploy only skills to a specific tool
mmm deploy --config /path/to/dir/mmm.yaml --type skills --tools claude

# Check what's currently deployed
mmm status --config /path/to/dir/mmm.yaml
```

If you are already in the directory that contains the config file, a relative path is fine:

```bash
cd /path/to/dir/
mmm deploy --config mmm.yaml
mmm status --config mmm.yaml
```

The tool checks that each tool's base directory (e.g., `~/.gemini/`, `~/.codex/`, `~/.claude/`, `~/.codeium/windsurf/`) exists before copying. Tools not installed on your machine are skipped automatically.

`--config` is required for `deploy` and `status`. Relative config paths resolve from your current working directory. The CLI does not auto-discover `mmm.yaml`.

### 5. Update after changes

Edit your source files, then re-run `mmm deploy`. It will ask before overwriting existing files.

## Key files

- `mmm.yaml.example` — example config with all options documented
- `mock-mmm.yaml` — working config with mock data for testing
- `mock/` — sample context, skills, and subagents for testing
- `mock-target/` — empty target directories for test deployments

## Testing with mock data

```bash
uv tool install --editable /Users/mpallone/src/mpallone/marks-markdown-manager
mmm deploy --config mock-mmm.yaml    # deploy mock data
mmm status --config mock-mmm.yaml    # see what's deployed
mmm deploy --config mock-mmm.yaml --dry-run    # preview without writing
```
